## JAMstack

[JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) websites and apps that deliver better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.

Why you need to choose Netlify over WordPress or any other option ([A List of Content Management Systems for JAMstack Sites](https://headlesscms.org/)).

Wordpress hosting can get expensive over time. I wanted a way to lower my cost and started to look for better options. I was aware of the security risks also even though my sites have only been hacked in once and nothing was done to them that I know of. 

Option one that I found was static sites for increased speed and security.

[Netlify templates](https://templates.netlify.com/) deploy in minutes.

This site is built with [Eleventy + Netlify CMS Boilerplate](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/). After trying many of the other Netlify Template options, I found this to be the best working and easiest to use. This is coming from a Github beginner and Wordpress CMS user.
