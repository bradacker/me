Why you need to choose Netlify over WordPress or any other option.

Wordpress hosting can get expensive over time. I wanted a way to lower my cost and started to look for better options. I was aware of the security risks also even though my sites have only been hacked in once and nothing was done to them that I know of. 

Option one that I found was static sites for increased speed and security.

Static site generators.

Netlify templates deploy in minutes.
