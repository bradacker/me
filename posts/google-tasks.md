  I have a hard time sticking with a task manager and have decided to give
  Google Tasks another run now that it's recently added time and repeating
  options.

New for me (2019-03-19) you can now create a task for a specific time and also have it repeat. Before you could only select the day. It will be nice to see these in your calendar along with events.

Google has had tasks for as long as I can remember but never gave it much time. It also never got rid of it like many other Google projects over the years.

It only recently launched a mobile app (2018). Before you could only use the very basic [canvas website](https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas), which will now go away (2019-03-19 is the date I went to it and saw the notice).

Many people got frustrated with no updates and lack of features that many others provided. Google Calendar has and still is very popular from my experience. 

Google now has a sidebar in the Calendar for Tasks and Keep. Gmail has all three. The sidebar is collapsible for times you aren't using it.
