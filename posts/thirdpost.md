To transfer a domain from GoDaddy to Google Domains, follow these steps:

2. Next, go to the Google Domains website and click on the "Transfer domain" button.
3. On the next page, enter the domain you want to transfer and click "Continue."
4. Follow the prompts to complete the transfer process. You may be asked to provide the authorization code, as well as other information such as the domain's expiration date and the name servers you want to use.
5. Once the transfer is complete, you will be able to manage your domain through your Google Domains account.

Note: It's important to keep in mind that transferring a domain can take several days to complete. During this time, your website and email may be disrupted, so it's a good idea to plan accordingly.\
