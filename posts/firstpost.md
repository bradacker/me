I haven't read a story book like this in a long time. After picking up some digital cash from Amazon by delaying shipping, I decided to pick this book up.

I will add more thoughts here when I'm done. Currently, I'm about 75% through the book.

## Final Thoughts

Overall great story for those that love dramas with drugs, girls and tech.

My rating is __/100.
