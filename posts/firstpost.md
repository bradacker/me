I haven't read a story book like this in a long time. It usually takes me forever or I don't complete the book. Not this time. After picking up some digital cash from Amazon by delaying shipping, I decided to pick [this book](https://amzn.to/2SYiAsT) up (Kindle version $1.99 at time of purchase and writing).

I will add more thoughts here when I'm done. Currently, I'm about 75% through the book.

## Final Thoughts

Overall great story for those that love dramas with drugs, girls and tech.

My rating is __/100.
