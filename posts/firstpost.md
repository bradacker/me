I recently had the opportunity to read "American Kingpin" by Nick Bilton and I was thoroughly impressed. 

I haven't read a story book like this in a long time. It usually takes me forever or I don't complete the book. Not this time.

After picking up some digital cash from Amazon by delaying shipping, I decided to pick [this book](https://amzn.to/2SYiAsT) up (Kindle version $1.99 at the time of purchase and writing). I highly recommend you do as well.

This book tells the true story of Ross Ulbricht, the man behind the notorious online black market known as the Silk Road.

The book details a great true story with lots of details. Amazing, since the author never interviewed Ross (the Kingpin) or his parents.

Another thing that sets this book apart is the level of research and detail that went into it. Bilton clearly did his homework and it shows in the level of depth and understanding that he brings to the story. He also does a great job of explaining the technical aspects of the Silk Road and how it all worked in layman's terms, making it accessible to even those who are not particularly tech-savvy.

One of the things that I loved most about this book is that it reads like a crime thriller. Bilton does a fantastic job of weaving together all of the different threads of the story and keeping the reader engaged from start to finish. The pacing is perfect and the writing is clear and concise.

This is one of the historic crimes of our lifetime. Ross Ulbright's laptop that he created and ran the Silk Road is in the Nuseum.

A small detail towards the beginning of the creation of the Silk Road is what ultimately got Ross caught. Why he was living in America or even stayed after the run in with cops was also stupid. Variety Jones (his online mentor) warned him and told him he needed to go into hiding.

## Final Thoughts

Overall a great story for those that love dramas with drugs, relationships and tech. 

I wonder how much of an impact Ross Ulbright made. His believes are what made him start the website. He was passionate about people's freedom to choose what they put in their body. I imagine that he made long term progress due to the fact weed is now legal either recreationally or medically in many states. No one will be able to measure the effect, if any, that Ross had.

Ultimately, "American Kingpin" is a must-read for anyone interested in true crime, the dark web, or the intersection of technology and crime. It's a gripping tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you wanting more. Highly recommended.
