I haven't read a story book like this in a long time. It usually takes me forever or I don't complete the book. Not this time.

After picking up some digital cash from Amazon by delaying shipping, I decided to pick [this book](https://amzn.to/2SYiAsT) up (Kindle version $1.99 at the time of purchase and writing). I highly recommend you do as well.

The book details a great true story with lots of details. Amazing, since the author never interviewed Ross (the Kingpin) or his parents.

This is one of the historic crimes of our lifetime. Ross Ulbright's laptop that he created and ran the Silk Road is in the Nuseum.

A small detail towards the beginning of the creation of the Silk Road is what ultimately got Ross caught. Why he was living in America or even stayed after the run in with cops was also stupid. Variety Jones (his online mentor) warned him and told him he needed to go into hiding.

## Final Thoughts

Overall a great story for those that love dramas with drugs, relationships and tech. 

I wonder how much of an impact Ross Ulbright made. His believes are what made him start the website. He was passionate about people's freedom to choose what they put in their body. I imagine that he made long term progress due to the fact weed is now legal either recreationally or medically in many states. No one will be able to measure the effect, if any, that Ross had.

My rating is **94/100**.
