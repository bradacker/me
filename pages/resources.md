This is a list of tools and other resources I use and recommend. This page will be an ongoing project that will be updated and expanded on.

**Disclosure:** Some of the products listed below have affiliate or referral links that will give me a small commission if you decide to purchase. This doesn't cost you any more money and let's me know that this page is useful. 

Also, since I'm pretty frugal, most of these are free or have generous free plans. Feel free to buy me a coffee by sending money to [Bradley Acker using PayPal.Me](https://www.paypal.me/bradacker)
